# Mutual-NDA
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement for enterprise use.
Balanced between the parties.

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) is simplifying commercial contracting through Standard Agreements. Our enterprise Cloud Terms (with DPA and SLA Attachments), Professional Services Agreement (PSA) and Mutual NDA let the parties start from a balanced foundation and negotiate by Cover Page, not redlines. The Bonterms Platform will leverage our Standard Agreements to take collaborative dealmaking to the next level. Bonterms is lawyer-led and funded by XYZ Capital and Wilson Sonsini.

## How the Mutual NDA was Created
The Mutual NDA was drafted by the [Bonterms Open Source Forms Committee](https://bonterms.com/committee/), progressing through four drafts over three months.

## How to Use
1. **Review** the NDA with your lawyer.
2. **Prepare** your Cover Page ([example](https://bonterms.com/forms/mutual-nda-cover-page-example/)).

3. **Send** your Cover Page to your counterparty.
- Add a cover note or try our [Explainer](https://bonterms.com/forms/mutual-nda-explainer/).
